Institution: National College of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated bone fracture detection system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It focuses on analyzing X-ray images to diagnose fractures efficiently and accurately, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

🔍 Key Features
✅ Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for deep learning-based feature extraction.
✅ Applied Canny Edge Detection combined with Random Forest for classical machine learning-based fracture detection.
✅ Used Transfer Learning with a pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model to improve accuracy.
✅ Followed the CRISP-DM methodology for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.
✅ Achieved high accuracy (94.59%) with EfficientNetB3 and Edge Detection, improving diagnostic reliability.
